cannot be divided by 3, or 5, or 7:
  101 => 1*1 (replace 0 to *)

can be divided by at least 1 of the 3 numbers:
  303 => FooFoo*Foo 
    (can be divided by 3, append Foo
     1st digit is 3, append Foo
     2nd digit is 0, append *
     3rd digit is 3, append Foo)
  
  10101 => FooQix**
    (can be divided by 3 and 7, append FooQix
     1st digit is 1, not in {3, 5, 7}, append nothing
     2nd digit is 0, append *
     3rd digit is 1, not in {3, 5, 7}, append nothing
     4th digit is 0, append *
     5th digit is 1, not in {3, 5, 7}, append nothing)

Rewrite rule:
- If the number is divisible by 3, write "Foo" instead of the number
- If the number is divisible by 5, add "Bar"
- If the number is divisible by 7, add "Qix"
- If the number cannot be divided by above 3 numbers 
    output the number with replacing 0 to *
- Otherwise
    For each digit 3, 5, 7, 0, add "Foo", "Bar", "Qix", "*" in the digits order.
